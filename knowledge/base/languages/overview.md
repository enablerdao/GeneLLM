# Programming Languages Overview

This document provides an overview of various programming languages, their characteristics, use cases, and comparisons.

## Categories of Programming Languages

Programming languages can be categorized in several ways:

### By Paradigm

- **Imperative**: Focus on how to execute, defines sequence of commands to change state
  - Examples: C, Fortran, BASIC
- **Procedural**: Based on the concept of procedure calls
  - Examples: C, Pascal, BASIC
- **Object-Oriented**: Based on the concept of "objects" containing data and methods
  - Examples: Java, C++, Python, Ruby
- **Functional**: Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions
  - Examples: Haskell, Lisp, Clojure, Scala
- **Declarative**: Focus on what to execute, defines what the program should accomplish
  - Examples: SQL, Prolog, HTML

### By Level of Abstraction

- **Low-level**: Provide little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture
  - Examples: Assembly language, Machine code
- **High-level**: Strong abstraction from the details of the computer
  - Examples: Python, Java, Ruby

### By Compilation vs. Interpretation

- **Compiled**: Translated to machine code before execution
  - Examples: C, C++, Rust, Go
- **Interpreted**: Executed directly without prior compilation to machine code
  - Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby
- **Hybrid (JIT compilation)**: Compiled during execution
  - Examples: Java, C#
